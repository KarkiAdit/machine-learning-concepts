# Machine Learning Concepts

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Concepts** repository! ðŸŽ‰ This project is part of my journey through the [Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize [2024]](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) course, where I explore and implement essential concepts in machine learning, data preprocessing, and model building. Each project and script here is a hands-on application of the topics covered in the course, focusing on practical understanding and implementation.

## Repository Structure

- **data-preprocessing/** ðŸ“‚: Contains scripts and notebooks for data cleaning, transformation, and normalization techniques.
- **models/** ðŸ“‚: Each subfolder focuses on a different machine learning algorithm or model, implemented with both Python and R, where applicable.
- **requirements.txt** ðŸ“„: Dependencies and libraries needed to run the scripts and notebooks in this repository.
- **README.md** ðŸ“„: You're here! An overview of the repository, course insights, and project highlights.

## Course Overview

The "Machine Learning A-Z" course is an in-depth dive into machine learning, covering everything from data preprocessing to advanced topics like NLP, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. My goal is to master these concepts and create powerful ML models applicable to real-world scenarios.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, encoding categorical data, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction.
- **Model Building**: From linear regression and decision trees to support vector machines and neural networks.
- **Model Evaluation**: Cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating model performance on test datasets.

## Projects and Concepts

Each project folder represents a different concept, technique, or algorithm explored in the course. Below are some of the core concepts and projects:

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- **Techniques**: Missing data imputation, encoding, feature scaling, and data transformation.
- **Goal**: Prepare datasets for modeling by ensuring clean, normalized, and transformed data ready for ML algorithms.

### 2. Regression Models

**Types**: Simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, polynomial regression.

- **Goal**: Predict continuous values, such as price predictions or stock market trends.

### 3. Classification Models

- **Techniques**: Logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, and Naive Bayes.
- **Goal**: Classify data into categories, for instance, spam detection or image classification.

### 4. Clustering Models

- **Algorithms**: K-Means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN.
- **Goal**: Group data based on similarity, useful for customer segmentation and anomaly detection.

### 5. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- **Steps**: Tokenization, stemming, bag of words, and TF-IDF.
- **Goal**: Process and analyze text data, like building sentiment analysis or chatbots.
